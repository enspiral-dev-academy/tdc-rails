**Note**: The degree to which we drill down will vary from person to person depending on motivation, ability, and available time. The above lists are possible topics. No student will cover all of them or even a majority. Some may be touched on lightly, others in more depth. But all students will be made aware of them.

## Week 1 Sprint
During this week we'll delve deeply into Garrett's _Five Elements of User Experience_. The five elements will become the framework within which we will discuss what a website/web app is and how to build one.
