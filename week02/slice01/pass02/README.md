# Adding a home page template

Let's begin by deleting the line in our "site#index" (Site controller, index action) that renders text. This will bring us back to this code:

```ruby
class SiteController < ApplicationController
  def index
  end
end
```

And this error in the browser:

![Missing template](/images/missing-template.png)

As we mentioned in our first pass at this code, what this tells us is that Rails is looking in the `app/views` folder for a `site/index` template in the `html` format, possibly using a handler such as `erb`.

Let's begin by creating a simple HTML file for the SiteController to find.

In the `app/views` folder, we'll create a folder called `site`. The name of this folder *must match the name of the controller*. The **SiteController** will look for its views in this folder.

The view names *must match the name of the action* from which they are called. In this instance the action is `index`, so our view will be `index.html`. Let's create this file and we'll add our text there rather than rendering it directly from the controller:

![Site index.html template](/images/site-index-html-template.png)

Now let's reload our page in the browser. Looks the same, right? Maybe the line has moved a bit. If so, that's because of the default margins around the &lt;p&gt; element.

But wait! Let's look at the page source for our page. It looks like this:

![index.html template page source](/images/index-html-template-source.png)

Where did all that extra HTML come from?

Well, it turns out that Rails automatically looks for a wrapper template in the `app/views/layout` folder called `application.html.erb` and it takes the output of our `index.html` template and inserts it into the `application.html.erb` template at the point where we see the following:

```html
  <%= yield %>
```

The `.erb` extension on the `application.html.erb` file tells Rails to run this file through the ERB compiler before it sends it along to the client. The ERB (Embedded Ruby) compiler looks for compiler instructions. These instructions are enclosed in special brackets to distinguish them from the surrounding text or HTML.

If we want to run Ruby code in our template *without* outputting anything to the final HTML, we can use these brackets:

```html
 <% "this will not be added to the output" %>
```

If we're expecting output from the code, we'll need to add an = sign after the first bracket:

```html
 <%= "this will be added to the output" %>
```

The `yield` command is preceded by an = sign, so we can assume that the yield will be, uh, *yielding* output to the page. And indeed it will: it yields the output of the page template, in this instance, the `site/index.html` template.

In the head of the `application.html.erb` file we can see some other Ruby commands that produce output:

  - The `stylesheet_link_tag` command adds the &lt;link&gt; elements to our stylesheets.
  - The `javascript_include_tag` command adds the &lt;script&gt; tags that add our JavaScripts to the page.
  - The `csrf_meta_tags` adds a special &lt;meta&gt; element to the head with a code that helps us to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery.

Don't worry about what these do right now. Just understand that we can use ERB to add Ruby output to our pages, making them dynamic.

## Making our index template dynamic

So we can do the same with our `index.html` page, but first we'll need to rename it to `index.html.erb` so that Rails sends it through the ERB compiler.

```
mv app/views/site/index.html app/views/site/index.html.erb
```

Now we can pass data from the controller to our template. The easiest way to do this is with an *instance* variable on the controller. In Ruby, instance variables start with a @ sign:

```ruby
class SiteController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @title = "Welcome!"
  end
end
```

Now we can go to our templates and use this variable. In our `application.html.erb` template, we'll use it for the &lt;title&gt; element, and we'll provide a default in case we forget to set it on some page:

```html
<title><%= @title || "TDC Rules!" %></title>
```

And we'll add it to our `index.html.erb` template:

```html
<h1><%= @title %></h1>
<p>
  Hi, you found me! I'm the home page.
</p>
```

Don't forget the = sign or you will see no output! (Try leaving it out to see what happens.)
