# Rails CRUD (create, retreive, update, delete)

A large part of what you'll do with Rails is probably to build CRUD apps, or at least apps that involve some CRUD, where CRUD stands for creating new instances of a class, retrieving one or more instances of that class (for example, for display in a table), updating individual instances (or batches of instances), and deleting instances.
