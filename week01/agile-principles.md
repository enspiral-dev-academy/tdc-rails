# The Agile Method
[The Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/)
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

## [The 12 Principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)
- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. [ **Integrity** ]
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage. [ **Adapt** ]
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. [ **Iterate** ]
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. [ **Teamwork** ]
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. [ **Empathy and trust** ]
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. [ **Communication, face-to-face** ]
- Working software is the primary measure of progress. [ **Real world** ]
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. [ **Balance & sustainability** ]
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. [ **Practiced makes permanent** ]
- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential. [ **Simplicity** ]
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. [ **Autonomy** ]
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. [ **Feedback** ]
